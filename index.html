            Welcome to my website. My name is Jakub Szwedo, I’m a sophomore in standing at the University of Illinois Chicago, majoring in Computer Science.
            I chose Computer Science because, as a child, I was always curious about how different devices can communicate and operate with each other, and how we could influence what they could do.
            I’m always looking to learn something new, whether it's a programming language and using it effectively, or taking what I know and moving it up a notch by looking at various third-party tools.
            Recently, I started taking an interest in Cyber Security. Because I realized how important it is to keep internet privacy and general internet safety accessible for everyone, and not only those who go the extra mile to keep it that way.  
            I also enjoy working with others on school projects and at special interest groups from organizations like ACM and LUG.
