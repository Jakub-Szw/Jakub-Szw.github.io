            <p>My friends and I joined a hackathon hosted by the University of Illinois Chicago students. Our team of five built a bidding website with the 
                theme of helping small businesses. Users would post jobs with a budget, and companies would bid to win the job. I had a lot of fun, and I 
                gained a lot of team experience.

            <p>Over the summer, I got the opportunity to work with the IT Department for the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Chicago.
                I gained a great amount of experience in providing support via TDX ticketing: triaged/resolved hardware & software issues, configured peripherals. 
                As well as building and administrating VMs on Proxmox VM and automated OS imaging/deployment with FOG server standardize workstation rollouts.
